    "Ans 1. Escape characters are special characters used in programming to represent characters that are difficult or impossible to type or display directly in code or in text strings. These characters are typically represented by a backslash (\\) followed by another character, and the combination is interpreted as a single character. Escape characters can also be used in regular expressions, where they have special meanings that modify the behavior of the expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the backslash followed by the letter n (\\n) is an escape sequence that represents a new line character. Similarly, the backslash followed by the letter t (\\t) represents a tab character, and the backslash followed by another backslash (\\\\) represents a single backslash. This can be explained in the following code:\n",
