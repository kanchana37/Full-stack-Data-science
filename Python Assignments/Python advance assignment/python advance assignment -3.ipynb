    "Ans 1. An abstract superclass is a class that is not meant to be instantiated directly, but instead serves as a template or blueprint for its subclasses. It defines a common interface or set of behaviors that its subclasses must implement, but does not provide a default implementation of those behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, abstract superclasses are typically created using the abc module and the ABC class. An abstract superclass can define abstract methods, which are methods that its subclasses must implement, but which have no implementation in the superclass. Any class that inherits from an abstract superclass must implement all of its abstract methods, or else it will also be treated as an abstract class and cannot be instantiated directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract superclasses are a key component of object-oriented programming and are useful for creating hierarchies of related classes that share common behaviors or properties. They allow you to define a common interface for a group of classes, while also providing a level of abstraction that can make your code more flexible and easier to maintain."
